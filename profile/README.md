## 🚧 Current Project: **Easley**

**Easley** is a modular, object-oriented C# networking library built for developers who demand **performance**, **security**, **speed**, and **extensibility**. Whether you're building multiplayer games or real-time systems, Easley provides low-level control with a clean and intuitive interface — making networking feel easy without sacrificing power.

### Key goals of Easley:
- ⚡ **Speed-first architecture** — minimize allocations, optimize memory access  
- 🔧 **Modular by design** — plug in what you need, discard what you don’t  
- 🧠 **Object-oriented networking** — work with high-level abstractions, not raw packets  
- 🔐 **Secure & reliable** — built-in support for encryption and robust error handling  

If you've ever wanted the performance of native code with the ease of modern C# patterns, Easley is your weapon of choice.
